# Scripts

## `vercel-build-ignore.sh`

This script is used in the Vercel build step to determine if the given app should be ignored in the build step.

Usage:

```sh
bash scripts/vercel-build-ignore.sh APP_NAME
```

For example:

```sh
bash scripts/vercel-build-ignore.sh recnet-docs
```

The script will exit with 0 if the given app need to be ignored in [Vercel build step](https://vercel.com/docs/projects/overview#ignored-build-step), otherwise exit with 1. (Create new build)

Under the hood, it uses the `pnpm nx show projects --affected` command to show all affected projects by current changes. And use `grep` to check if the given app is in the list.

## What is TRPC

TL;DR.
[Trpc](https://trpc.io/) is a tool which provides type-safe API fetching between client & server (In our case, it sits between client-side aka browser and server-side aka Next.js's backend serverless functions). It makes data-fetching work like a function call. That's why it's called tRPC, which stands for "typed RPC(Remote Procedure Call)"

_Note_: TRPC only work when client and server are both in TypeScript and inside the same repo. So, it can work in Next.js project since it's a fullstack framework. It can also work in any Typescript-based monorepo.

Highly recommended to read this section in the official documentation to get familiar with trpc: [Becoming productive in an existing tRPC project](https://trpc.io/docs/getting-started#becoming-productive-in-an-existing-trpc-project)

## Why using it

- Type-safety API fetching. Without trpc, even if defining types at server-side, we still need to define types at client-side by casting types using `as`, or the data after fetching will be `any` type. With trpc, we define types at server-side, and the types are automatically inferred at client-side
- Extracting a data fetching layer. All data-fetching logics are put under `/server/routers` folder. (Without trpc, the Next.js's route handlers are put under `app/api/` and need to add a route.ts for each endpoint, which is troublesome.)
- Integrate with [Tanstack-query(react-query)](https://tanstack.com/query/v5/docs/framework/react/overview), the most popular client-side data-fetching library in React ecosystem, which offers rich functionalities such as caching, refetching, loading states, invalidation, and pagination queries. Read trpc docs for [React Query Integration](https://trpc.io/docs/client/react)
- Also support server-side data-fetching (fetching data server-side) which can be used inside React Server Component and any server environment. Read [Server Side Call](https://trpc.io/docs/server/server-side-calls)

## How to use it

### Add new procedure in a router

A router is a collection of procedures (api endpoints). We can group procedures by their functionalities to different routers.
We put routers under `server/routers` folder and merge them into a single router in `server/index.ts`.

On the server side, you defined trpc procedures (api endpoints) and trpc will turn them into API endpoints. It will be looked like this.

```ts
// in /server/routers/...
import { router, publicProcedure } from "../trpc";

const router = router({
  getMe: publicProcedure
      .input(z.object({...})) // write the zod schema of what input should be passed to this endpoint
      .output(z.object({ user: userSchema.nullable() })) // write the zod schema of what this endpoint will output
      .query(async (opts) => {
        // server-side logic here, this will be executed at server-side
        // write some downstream data fetchs or db operations here
        const { tokens } = opts.ctx; // We can store tokens in the context object
        if (!tokens) {
          return {
            user: null,
          };
        }
        const user = await getUserByTokens(tokens);
        return {
          user,
        };
      }),
   // other procedures...
})
```

It can be integrated will zod to do input/output validation, which is useful for catching wrong data shape.

We also extract similar logic to middleware procedures, which can be reused by multiple procedures. See `server/routers/middleware.ts`

### Client-side data-fetching

On the client side, trpc provides a useful query client which inherits the popular data-fetching library tanstack-query (formerly called react-query). We can use `useQuery` hook to fetch data from the server, use `useMutation` hook to send data to the server, use `useInfiniteQuery` hook to fetch paginated data, etc. [Learn more](https://trpc.io/docs/client/react)

```ts
import { trpc } from "@recnet/recnet-web/app/_trpc/client";

const { data, isPending, isError, isFetching } = trpc.getMe.useQuery();
// ^^ the type of "data" here is { user: User | null } just like we defined in our router
```

### Server-side data-fetching

You can also use trpc to fetch data server-side. This is useful when you want to fetch data in a server environment (e.g. a serverless function, react server component, or server action). [Learn more](https://trpc.io/docs/server/server-side-calls)

```ts
import { serverClient } from "@recnet/recnet-web/app/_trpc/serverClient";

const { user } = await serverClient.getMe();
// ^^ the type of "user" here is User | null just like we defined in our router
```
